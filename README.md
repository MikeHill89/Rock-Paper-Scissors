# Rock Paper Scissors Rock Paper Scissors Project from The Odin Project

## What did I learn?

- Understand JavaScript fundamentals (variables, conditionals, functions, loops,
  arrays) 
- Implement simple logic and decision-making processes 
- Interact with the DOM using JavaScript to create user interfaces 
- Develop problem-solving skills by breaking down complex problems into multiple
  smaller steps
- Create a functional and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript
  and HTML/CSS 
- Learn and practice using Git and Github for version control and collaboration.

The Rock Paper Scissors assignment from The Odin Project was a great opportunity
for me to learn and practice some of the fundamental concepts of JavaScript.
Through this project, I was able to understand how to use variables,
conditional statements, functions, loops, and arrays to create a simple and
interactive game.

By building this game, I was able to develop my problem-solving skills and
practice implementing logical operations and decision-making processes. The
assignment also helped me understand how to interact with the Document Object
Model (DOM) in JavaScript, which is essential for creating interactive user
interfaces.

In addition, this project also emphasized the importance of version control and
collaboration with other developers by using Git and Github. By working with
these tools, I learned how to manage my code, keep track of changes, and
collaborate effectively with other developers. Throughout the project I was
active on the discord server of The Odin Project discussing my personal progress
on this project without asking for the straight solution. It was a lot of fun.
